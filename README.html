  <p style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</p>
  
I am writing to thank you for all the great work you have done taking care of getting 10th rented out and keeping the tenant happy, as well as managing this major remodel and prep for new renters. I know you enjoy doing it but it is still very much appreciated. Included is a small token of my appreciation. You see how I came up with an excuse to give this to you when really I just think its cool and want someone to be cool with me! Attached is your “Super Yuppy Starter Pack Pro”. You really have to have the whole package to feel the true sensation of superiority over the plebeians.

Here are some resources I found helpful for getting you going:

Hope this brings you joy, fun, or at least some short lived entertainment.

Much love,
Brdr
